- CSS  
- Bootstrap: CSS grid-system framework.

### Functionality

   The information is user generated where the application takes in variables such as `Train Name`, `First Train Time`, and `Destination`. Based on the `First Train Time` and the `Frequency` of train line, the application will calculate the time the next train will arrive and the wait duration. All of the data is stored using **Firebase**.
